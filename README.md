Project Title: Next Word Prediction Model using Python and TensorFlow
Overview:

This project develops a Next Word Prediction model using Python and TensorFlow, leveraging natural language processing techniques. It aims to predict subsequent words in a sentence, given a seed text. The model is trained on a dataset of Sherlock Holmes stories, providing it with a rich linguistic structure for learning word sequence patterns.

Description:

Dataset: The model is trained on plain text stories of Sherlock Holmes.
Technology Stack:
Python: For scripting and data manipulation.
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the neural network.
NumPy: For efficient array computations.
Key Processes:
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization of text and conversion of categorical data into numerical formats.
Model Architecture:
Sequential Model: Linear stacking of layers.
Embedding Layer: Converts input sequences into dense vectors of fixed size.
LSTM Layer: Captures sequential data patterns.
Dense Layer: Generates probabilistic predictions for the next word.
Model Training and Evaluation: Using categorical crossentropy loss and accuracy metrics.
Application: Allows prediction of the next few words based on the input seed text.
Methodology:

Data Import and Preprocessing: Reading text data and preprocessing using tokenization and padding.

Model Development:
Building a Sequential model with Embedding, LSTM, and Dense layers.
Training the model on the preprocessed text data.
Prediction Implementation: Generating word predictions for a given seed text.

Achievements:
