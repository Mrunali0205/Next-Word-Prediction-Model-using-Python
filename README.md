# Next-Word-Prediction-Model-using-Python
This Python project develops a Next Word Prediction Model using TensorFlow and Keras. It preprocesses Sherlock Holmes stories, tokenizes them, and uses n-grams for training a model with an Embedding layer, LSTM, and Dense layer. The trained model predicts the next words in a sequence, demonstrating effective text understanding.
